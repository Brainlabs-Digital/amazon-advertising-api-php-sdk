# Amazon Advertising API PHP SDK

This is a forked version of an open source SDK for the Amazon Advertising API, which is used by our wrapper library [amazonian](https://github.com/Brainlabs-Digital/amazonian).

The reason we needed to fork the SDK is just so that we could update some hardcoded API versions (the original SDK is no longer maintained).

For more details, see [Toby S handover notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16rvnj08ILUUTvCp5i_TcuMJtHwI_2JfsqmaAXcfT64c/edit#heading=h.fb9h4nan9ypo).
